### Wee baby blog

Using the dbc Sinatra skeleton, to make a wee blog.

*Current version:* 3! Now with skinny controllers and more helper methods.

You are required to have an account to create posts, and a user can only edit or delete posts that they have authored. Posts with no authors can't be edited by anyone (which are the original database seeds prior to the ```user_id``` requirement).  

AJAX is used to display the login, sign up, and new post forms.
