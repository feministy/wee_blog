*Current version:* 2!

You are required to have an account to create posts, and a user can only edit or delete posts that they have authored. Posts with no authors can't be edited by anyone (which are the original database seeds prior to the ```user_id``` requirement).  
  
Next iteration: pagination, AJAX for some requests, error handling.
